# CovarianceEstimation.jl

Lightweight robust covariance estimation in Julia i.e. if you have a data matrix `X` of size `n×p` corresponding to `n` observations with `p` features, this package will help you to obtain an estimator of the covariance matrix of size `p×p` associated with this data.

**Note**: if you are interested in covariance estimation in the context of a linear regression, consider for now the package [CovarianceMatrices.jl](https://github.com/gragusa/CovarianceMatrices.jl) which focuses around that case.

## Quick start

```julia
using CovarianceEstimation

X = randn(5, 7)

S_uncorrected  = cov(SimpleCovariance(), X)
S_corrected    = cov(SimpleCovariance(corrected=true), X)

# using linear shrinkage with different targets
LSE = LinearShrinkage
# - Ledoit-Wolf target + shrinkage
method = LSE(ConstantCorrelation())
S_ledoitwolf = cov(method, X)
# - Chen target + shrinkage (using the more verbose call)
method = LSE(target=DiagonalCommonVariance(), shrinkage=:rblw)
S_chen_rblw = cov(method, X)
method = LSE(target=DiagonalCommonVariance(), shrinkage=:oas)
S_chen_oas = cov(method, X)

# a pre-defined shrinkage can be used as well
method = LinearShrinkage(DiagonalUnitVariance(), 0.5)
# using a given shrinkage
S_05 = cov(method, X)
```

## Currently supported algorithms

In this section, `X` is the data matrix of size `n × p`, `S` is the sample covariance matrix with `S = κ (Xc' * Xc)` where `κ` is either `n` (uncorrected) or `n-1` (corrected) and `Xc` is the centred data matrix (see [docs](https://mateuszbaran.github.io/CovarianceEstimation.jl/dev)).

* `SimpleCovariance`: basic corrected or uncorrected sample covariance (implemented in `StatsBase.jl`).

**Time complexity**: `O(p²n)` with a low constant

### Sample covariance based methods

These methods build an estimator of the covariance derived from `S`. They are implemented using abstract covariance estimation interface from `StatsBase.jl`.

* `LinearShrinkage`: James-Stein type estimator of the form `(1-λ)S+λF` where `F` is a target and `λ∈[0,1]` a shrinkage intensity.
  - common targets are implemented following the taxonomy given in [**1**] along with Ledoit-Wolf optimal shrinkage intensities [**2**].
  - in the case of the `DiagonalCommonVariance` target, a Rao-Blackwellised Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage (`:rblw`) and Oracle-Approximating shrinkage (`:oas`) are also supported (see [**3**]).
  - **Note**: `S` is symmetric semi-positive definite so that if the `F` is symmetric positive definite and provided `λ` is non-zero, the estimator obtained after shrinkage is also symmetric positive definite. For the diagonal targets `DiagonalUnitVariance`, `DiagonalCommonVariance` and `DiagonalUnequalVariance` the target is necessarily SPD.
* `AnalyticalNonlinearShrinkage`: estimator of the form `MΛM'` where `M` and `Λ` are matrices derived from the eigen decomposition of `S`.[**4**]
* `BiweightMidcovariance`: robust estimator, described more in the [documentation](https://mateuszbaran.github.io/CovarianceEstimation.jl/dev/man/methods/#Biweight-midcovariance).[**5**]

**Time complexity**:
- Linear shrinkage: `O(p²n)` with a low constant (main cost is forming `S`)
- Nonlinear shrinkage:
  * if `p<n`: `O(p²n + n²)` with a moderate constant (main cost is forming `S` and manipulating a matrix of `n²` elements)
  * if `p>n`: `O(p³)` with a low constant (main cost is computing the eigen decomposition of `S`).
- Biweight midcovariance: `O(p²n)`

### Other estimators (coming)

These are estimators that may be implemented in the future, see also [this review  paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.02995.pdf).

* Sparsity based estimators for either the covariance or the precision
* Rank based approaches
* [POET](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1201.0175.pdf)
* HAC
* ...

For HAC (and other estimators of covariance of coefficient of regression models) you can currently use the [CovarianceMatrices.jl](https://github.com/gragusa/CovarianceMatrices.jl) package.

## Comparison to existing libraries

Rough benchmarks are run over random matrices of various sizes (`40x20, 20x40, 400x200, 200x400`).
These benchmarks should (as usual) be taken with a pinch of salt but essentially a significant speedup should be expected for a standard problem.

* **Sklearn** (implements `DiagonalCommonVariance` target with `oas` and `lw` shrinkage)
  - average speedup: `5x`
* **Corpcor** (implements `DiagonalUnequalVariance` target with `ss` shrinkage)
  - average speedup: `22x`
* **Ledoit-Wolf 1** (implements `ConstantCorrelation` target with `lw` shrinkage, we used Octave for the comparison)
  - average speedup: `12x`
* **Ledoit-Wolf 2** (implements `AnalyticalNonlinearShrinkage`)
  - average speedup: `25x`
* **Astropy** (implements `BiweightMidcovariance`)
  - average speedup: `3x`
